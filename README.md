# Using Correlation Analysis to Locate Encryption Activity in Electromagnetic Side-Channels

## General
This repository contains the source code used for locating encryption activity in signals collected from electromagnetic side-channels, emitted from an nRF52 DK development board.

## Folders
### capture
This folder contains scripts for capturing data from a target device.
### correlation
This folder contains the main toolset with scripts to create templates, plot data
and locate encryption in a trace.
### gnuradio
This folder contains flow-diagrams and scripts generated with GNURadio. They are
used as a basis for the scripts in 'capture'.
